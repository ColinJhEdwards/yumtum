Issues I ran into with yumtum (but overcame!)

using typescript in general

using typescript on functions performing an api call, how to set up an interface and the correct function type to use.

the "summary" of a recipe listed in the api results is html code, had to research what "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" was and find an alternative to avoid
cross site scripting(Xss) which i dont believe will be an issue for this website but I'd prefer to practice good habits

styling the recipe cards to have the text over the image with a linear gradient background to make the text pop

using useParams from react router dom to perform api calls based off of info in the url

figuring out how to maintain the width of images on splide carousel
